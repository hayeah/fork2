- A command starts with a line that has a leading `:`.
- A parameter starts with a line that has a leading `$`.
- A command may have parameters in lines that follow.

- A comment starts with a line that has a leading `#`.

- A command or a paramter may have a string payload.
- Heredoc: A heredoc value after a command or action, with `<`.
- If not using heredoc, the payload is the string up to the end of line.


### Example: Nested HEREDOCs

If your output heredoc payload contains heredoc, choose a different UNIQUE heredoc string (e.g. PINEAPPLE, MAXIMUS, HEREDOC2, HEREDOCMETA, etc.) to delimit this output.
